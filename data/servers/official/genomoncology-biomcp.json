Built following the Model Context\nProtocol (MCP), it connects AI systems to authoritative biomedical data\nsources, enabling them to answer questions about clinical trials, scientific\nliterature, and genomic variants with precision and depth.\n\n[![▶️ Watch the video](./docs/blog/images/what_is_biomcp_thumbnail.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKxOWrWUUhM)\n\n## MCPHub Certification\n\nBioMCP is certified by [MCPHub](https://mcphub.com/mcp-servers/genomoncology/biomcp). This certification ensures that BioMCP follows best practices for Model Context Protocol implementation and provides reliable biomedical data access.\n\n## Why BioMCP?\n\nWhile Large Language Models have broad general knowledge, they often lack\nspecialized domain-specific information or access to up-to-date resources.\nBioMCP bridges this gap for biomedicine by:\n\n- Providing **structured access** to clinical trials, biomedical literature,\n  and genomic variants\n- Enabling **natural language queries** to specialized databases without\n  requiring knowledge of their specific syntax\n- Supporting **biomedical research** workflows through a consistent interface\n- Functioning as an **MCP server** for AI assistants and agents\n\n## Biomedical Data Sources\n\nBioMCP integrates with multiple biomedical data sources:\n\n### Literature Sources\n\n- **PubTator3/PubMed** ",
