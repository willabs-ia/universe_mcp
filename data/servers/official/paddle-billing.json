We take care of payments, tax, subscriptions, and metrics with one unified API that does it all.\n\nThis is a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) server that provides LLMs and AI agents with tools for interacting with the Paddle API.\n\n> **Important:** This MCP server works with Paddle Billing. It does not support Paddle Classic. To work with Paddle Classic, see: [Paddle Classic API reference](https://developer.paddle.com/classic/api-reference/1384a288aca7a-api-reference?utm_source=dx&utm_medium=paddle-mcp-server)\n\n[![Install MCP Server](https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-dark.svg)](https://cursor.com/install-mcp?name=paddle&config=eyJjb21tYW5kIjoibnB4IC15IEBwYWRkbGUvcGFkZGxlLW1jcCIsImVudiI6eyJQQURETEVfQVBJX0tFWSI6InBkbF9zZGJ4X2FwaWtleV8iLCJQQURETEVfRU5WSVJPTk1FTlQiOiJzYW5kYm94In19)\n\n## Features\n\nThe MCP server has near parity with the Paddle API, allowing AI assistants and agents to:\n\n* Manage your full Paddle catalog\n* View customer, purchase, and provisioning information\n* Handle subscription, payment, and refund workflows\n* Debug billing and order management issues\n* Create and adjust transactions directly in conversation\n* Generate financial reports for financial and operational insights\n* Implement and test Paddle integrations faster\n\n<details>\n<summary>Available",
