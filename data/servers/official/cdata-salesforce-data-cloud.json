For full read, write, update, delete, and action capabilities and a simplified setup, check out our [CData MCP Server for Salesforce Data Cloud](https://www.cdata.com/drivers/salesforcedc/download/mcp/). \n## Purpose\nWe created this read-only MCP Server to allow LLMs (like Claude Desktop) to query live data Salesforce Data Cloud supported by the [CData JDBC Driver for Salesforce Data Cloud](https://www.cdata.com/drivers/salesforcedc/jdbc/).\n\nCData JDBC Driver connects to Salesforce Data Cloud by exposing them as relational SQL models.\n\nThis server wraps that driver and makes Salesforce Data Cloud data available through a simple MCP interface, so LLMs can retrieve live information by asking natural language questions — no SQL required.\n\n## Setup Guide\n1. Clone the repository:\n      ```bash\n      git clone https://github.com/cdatasoftware/salesforce-data-cloud-mcp-server-by-cdata.git\n      cd salesforce-data-cloud-mcp-server-by-cdata\n      ```\n2. Build the server:\n      ```bash\n      mvn clean install\n      ``` \n      This creates the JAR file: CDataMCP-jar-with-dependencies.jar\n2. Download and install the CData JDBC Driver for {source}: [https://www.cdata.com/drivers/salesforcedc/download/jdbc](https://www.cdata.com/drivers/salesforcedc/download/jdbc/)\n3.
