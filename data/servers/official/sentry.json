    "readme_excerpt": "**Note** - This has largely been superceded by the Sentry [Remote-MCP Server](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-mcp) which supports a lot more capabilities (auth, better tooling, etc...). This one exists for educational purposes as a standalone MCP server; but in all likelihood you'll want to use the remote. You can see it live at https://mcp.sentry.dev\n\n# Sentry MCP Server\n\nA Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for interacting with Sentry.
