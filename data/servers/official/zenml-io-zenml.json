It acts like a\n\"USB-C port for AI applications\" - providing a standardized way to connect AI\nmodels to different data sources and tools.\n\nMCP follows a client-server architecture where:\n- **MCP Hosts**: Programs like Claude Desktop or IDEs that want to access data through MCP\n- **MCP Clients**: Protocol clients that maintain 1:1 connections with servers\n- **MCP Servers**: Lightweight programs that expose specific capabilities through the standardized protocol\n- **Local Data Sources**: Your computer's files, databases, and services that MCP servers can securely access\n- **Remote Services**: External systems available over the internet that MCP servers can connect to\n\n## What is ZenML?\n\nZenML is an open-source platform for building and managing ML and AI pipelines.\nIt provides a unified interface for managing data, models, and experiments.\n\nFor more information, see the [ZenML website](https://zenml.io) and [our documentation](https://docs.zenml.io).\n\n## Fea",
