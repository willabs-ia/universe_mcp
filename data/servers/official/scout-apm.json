Use it to get traces and errors with line-of-code information\nthat the AI can use to target fixes right in your editor and codebase. N+1 queries, slow endpoints,\nslow queries, memory bloat, throughput issues - all your favorite performance problems surfaced\nand explained right where you are working.\n\n**If this makes your life a tiny bit better, why not :star: it?!**\n\n## Setup Wizard\n\nThe simplest way to configure and start using the Scout MCP is with our interactive setup wizard.\nIt handles all the prereqs and installation steps for you.\n\nRun via npx:\n```bash\nnpx @scout_apm/wizard\n```\n\nBuild and run from source:\n```bash\ncd ./wizard\nnpm install\nnpm run build\nnode dist/wizard.js\n```\n\nThe wizard will guide you through:\n- Selecting your A",
