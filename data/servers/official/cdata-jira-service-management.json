    "readme_excerpt": "# jira-service-management-mcp-server-by-cdata\nCData's Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server for Jira Service Management\n\n:heavy_exclamation_mark: This project builds a local, read-only MCP server. For fully remote MCP access, check out the first managed MCP platform: [CData Connect AI](https://www.cdata.com/ai/). For locally hosted, full read, write, update, delete, and action capabilities and a simplified setup, check out our [CData MCP Server for Jira Service Management](https://www.cdata.com/drivers/jiraservicedesk/download/mcp/).\n## Purpose\nWe created this read-only MCP Server to allow LLMs (like Claude Desktop) to query live data Jira Service Management supported by the [CData JDBC Driver for Jira Service Management](https://www.cdata.com/drivers/jiraservicedesk/jdbc/).\n\nCData JDBC Driver connects to Jira Service Management by exposing them as relational SQL models.\n\nThis server wraps that driver and makes Jira Service Management data available through a simple MCP interface, so LLMs can retrieve live information by asking natural language questions — no SQL required.\n\n## Setup Guide\n1. Clone the repository:\n      ```bash\n      git clone https://github.com/cdatasoftware/jira-service-management-mcp-server-by-cdata.git\n      cd jira-service-management-mcp-server-by-cdata\n      ```\n2. Build the server:\n      ```bash\n      mvn clean install\n      ``` \n      This creates the JAR file: CDataMCP-jar-with-dependencies.jar\n2. Download and install the CData JDBC Driver for {source}:",
