See [API.md](API.md) for full documentation.\n- Custom instructions for MCP host to use the server\n- Intelligent context optimization to conserve LLM tokens while preserving data accessibility\n- Smart response slicing with configurable page sizes to prevent context overflow\n- Opaque cursor pagination using Base64URL-encoded strings instead of complex parameters\n- Automatic truncation of large data fields with clear indicators and access guidance\n- Standardized ToolResponse model with structured JSON responses and foll",
