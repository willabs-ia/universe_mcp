Fetch and transform raw data from platforms like Google Ads, Facebook, HubSpot, and Salesforce into actionable intelligence for smarter, faster decision-making with accurate, up-to-date business information.\n\n\n## Use Cases\nGet data from your Coupler.io data flows and ask your AI tool questions about it, like you would ask your fellow data analyst:\n\n### Marketing: \n1. What's our overall customer acquisition cost across all paid channels this quarter compared to last quarter? I need this for the board meeting.\n2. Show me the ROI breakdown by marketing channel for the past 6 months. I need to reallocate our annual budget.\n3. Which campaigns are contributing most to our pipeline revenue? I want to double down on what's working.\n\n### Sales:\n1. Can you pull the sales pipeline report for this month? I need to see how many deals are in each stage and the total value at each stage.\n",
