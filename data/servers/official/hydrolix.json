To get the best results out of your model while using the Hydrolix MCP server, we recommend the following:\n\n* Refer to your Hydrolix database by name and request tool usage in your prompts (e.g., \"Using MCP tools to access my Hydrolix database, please ...\")\n  - This encourages the model to use the MCP tools available and minimizes hallucinations.\n* Include time ranges in your prompts (e.g., \"Between December 5 2023 and January 18 2024, ...\") and specifically request that the output be ordered by timestamp.\n  - This prompts the model to write more efficient queries that take advantage of [primary key optimizations](https://hydrolix.io/blog/optimizing-latest-n-row-queries/)\n\n### Health Check Endpo",
