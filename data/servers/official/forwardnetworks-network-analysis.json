    "readme_excerpt": "# Forward MCP\n\n**Version 2.2.0**\n\nForward MCP is an open-source server that provides a set of tools and APIs for interacting with Forward Networks' platform. It enables automation, analysis, and integration with network data using the MCP protocol.\n\n## Features\n- Exposes Forward Networks tools via the MCP protocol (55+ tools)\n- Supports prompt workflows and contextual resources\n- **NEW**: Instance lock protection prevents multiple server instances\n- **NEW**: Additional API functions for snapshot, location, and device management\n- **NEW**: Bloomsearch integration for efficient handling of large NQE results\n- **NEW**: Automatic bloom filter generation for fast data filtering\n- **NEW**: Persistent bloom indexes for network analysis\n- Designed for easy integration and automation\n\n## High-Level Architecture\n- **cmd/server/main.go**: Entry point for the server. Initializes configuration, logging, and registers tools, prompts, and resources.\n- **internal/service**: Implements the core Forward MCP service logic.\n- **internal/service/bloom_search.go**: Bloomsearch integration for large result handling.\n- **internal/config**: Handles configuration loading (API URL, credentials, etc).\n- **internal/logger**: Provides logging utilities.\n\n## Prerequisites\n- Go 1.20 or later\n- Access to Forward Networks API (API URL and API Key)\n\n## Build Instructions\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/forward-mcp/forward-mcp.git\ncd forward-mcp\ngo build -o forward-mcp ./cmd/server\n```\n\n## Run Instructions\nS",
