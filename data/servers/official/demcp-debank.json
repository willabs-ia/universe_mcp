    "readme_excerpt": "# DeBanK MCP Server\n\nA stateless Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for interacting with the DeBanK API to retrieve blockchain and DeFi data.\n\n## Overview\n\nThis project implements a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides various tools for querying blockchain data, including chains, protocols, tokens, pools, and user assets. Built with the [`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcp), it leverages the HTTP Streamable transport to provide a modern, efficient API interface.\n\nThe server is designed to be completely stateless, with each request being handled independently, making it highly scalable and robust for production environments.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Stateless Architecture**: Each request creates a new server instance and transport\n- **Comprehensive DeFi Data Tools**: Access to chains, protocols, tokens, pools, and user data\n- **Pagination Support**: All list-returning endpoints support pagination\n- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and reporting\n\n## Tools Available\n\n| Tool Name | Description |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| `get_chain_info` | Get information about blockchains |\n| `get_protocol_info` | Get information about DeFi protocols |\n| `get_token_info` | Get information about tokens |\n| `get_pool_info` | Get detailed information about a specific liquidity pool |\n| `get_user_assets` | Get information about a user's assets across different blockchains |\n| `get_user_activities` | Get information about a user's protocol posi",
