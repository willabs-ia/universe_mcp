It allows AI agents to manage your KSM secrets-such as listing, creating, retrieving, and deleting records and folders-while protecting your KSM application credentials. Sensitive operations require user confirmation, ensuring you maintain control over your data.\n\n## Quick User Guide\n\n### Option 1: Using Docker (Recommended)\n\n1.  **Get KSM Base64 Configuration:**\n    *   Log into the [Keeper Secrets Vault](https://keepersecurity.com/vault).\n    *   Navigate to your Secrets Manager, Application, then to the \"Devices\" tab.\n    *   Click \"Add Device\" and copy the **base64-encoded configuration string** provided (it usually starts with `ewog...`).\n    > **Important**: The base64 config contains your KSM application's credentials. Keep it secure and never commit it to version control.\n\n2.  **Configure Claude Desktop:**\n    *   Open your Claude Desktop configuration file:\n        *   macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n        *   Windows: `%APPDATA%\\Claude\\claude_desktop_config.json`\n        *   Linux: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n    *   Add or update the `ksm` server entry as follows, replacing `YOUR_BASE64_CONFIG_STRING_HERE` with your actual base64 config:\n\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"ksm\": {\n",
