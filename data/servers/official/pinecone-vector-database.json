The Pinecone Developer MCP Server allows you to connect these tools with Pinecone projects and documentation.\n\nOnce connected, AI tools can:\n* Search [Pinecone documentation](https://docs.pinecone.io) to answer questions accurately.\n* Help you configure indexes based on your application's needs.\n* Generate code informed by your index configuration and data, as well as Pinecone documentation and examples.\n* Upsert and search for data in indexes, allowing you to test queries and evaluate results within your dev environment.\n\nSee the [docs](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/operations/mcp-server) for more detailed information.\n\nThis MCP server is focused on improving the experience of developers working with Pinecone as part of their technology stack. It is intended for use with coding assistants. Pinecone also offers the [Assistant MCP](https://github.com/pinecone-io/assistant-mcp), which is designed to provide AI assistants with relevant context sourced from your knowledge base.\n\n## Setup\n\nTo configure the MCP server to access your Pinecone project, you will need to generate an API key using the [console](https://app.pinecone.io). Without an API key, your AI tool will still be able to search documentation. However, it will not be able to manage or query your index",
