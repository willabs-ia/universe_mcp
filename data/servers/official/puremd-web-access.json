Like a CDN for markdown content, it globally caches responses for future requests to the same resource, relieving stress on origin web servers.\n\n**Without puremd-mcp, local agents may fail to fetch web content.** puremd-mcp teaches MCP clients like Cursor, Windsurf, and Claude Desktop how to adopt the functionality of pure.md, giving them web unblocking and searching capabilities.\n\npuremd-mcp comes with two tools:\n\n- `unblock-url` - Extract markdown from web pages without getting blocked\n- `search-web` - Search the web for a query and concatenate results into markdown\n\nThe [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction), developed by Anthropic, is an open standard that enables AI systems to seamlessly interact with an ecosystem of tooling. With it, MCP clients like Cursor, Windsurf, and Claude Desktop can learn how to use a variety of APIs and other functionality.\n\n## Authentication\n",
