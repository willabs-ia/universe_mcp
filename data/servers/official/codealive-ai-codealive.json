It enriches the context for AI agents like Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, etc., making them 35% more efficient and up to 84% faster.\n\nIt's like Context7, but for your (large) codebases.\n\nIt allows AI-Coding Agents to:\n\n*   **Find relevant code faster** with semantic search\n*   **Understand the bigger picture** beyond isolated files  \n*   **Provide better answers** with full project context\n*   **Reduce costs and time** by removing guesswork\n\n## 🛠 Available Tools\n\nOnce connected, you'll have access to these powerful tools:\n\n1. **`get_data_sources`** - List your indexed repositories and workspaces\n2. **`codebase_search`**",
