If using the StreamableHTTP transport, always configure the MCP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS environment variable to restrict access to trusted origins only. This helps prevent DNS rebinding attacks and other cross-origin vulnerabilities.\n\n> **Security Note:** Depending on the query, the MCP server may expose certain Terraform data to the MCP client and LLM. Do not use the MCP server with untrusted MCP clients or LLMs.\n\n> **Legal Note:** Your use of a third party MCP Client/LLM is subject solely to the terms of u",
