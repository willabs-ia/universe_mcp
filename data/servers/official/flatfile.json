It is strongly recommended to filter the tools to only include the ones you need. This can be done by passing the `--enabled-tools` flag to the MCP Server along with a comma-separated list of the tools you want to enable. If the `--enabled-tools` flag is not passed, all tools will be enabled.\n\nExample:\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n      // ...\n      \"mcp-server-flatfile\": {\n         \"command\": \"npx\",\n         \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@flatfile/mcp-server\", \"--ena",
