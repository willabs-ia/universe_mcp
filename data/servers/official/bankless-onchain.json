It implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to allow AI models to access blockchain state and event data in a structured way.\n\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95732dff-ae5f-45a6-928a-1ae17c0ddf9d\n\n\n## Features\n\nThe server provides the following onchain data operations:\n\n### Contract Operations\n\n- **Read Contract State** (`read_contract`): Read state from smart contracts on various blockchain networks.\n    - Parameters: network, contract address, method, inputs, outputs\n    - Returns: Contract call results with typed values\n\n- **Get Proxy** (`get_proxy`): Retrieve proxy implementation contract addresses.\n    - Parameters: network, contract address\n    - Returns: Implementation contract address\n\n- **Get ABI** (`get_abi`): Fetch the ABI (Application Binary Interface) for a contract.\n    - Parameters: network, contract address\n    - Returns: Contract ABI in JSON format\n\n- **Get Source** (`get_source`): Retrieve the source code for a verified contract.\n    - Parameters: network, contract address\n    - Returns: Source code, ABI, compiler version, and other ",
