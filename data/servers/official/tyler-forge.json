Ask questions, generate code examples, and explore design system details.\n\n## What You Get\n\n**Tyler Forge™** is Tyler Technologies' comprehensive web component library and design system. This tool brings that documentation into your AI tools so you can:\n\n- **Discover components** - Find the right component for your needs\n- **Generate code** - Get framework-specific examples (Angular, React, Vue, Svelte)\n- **Validate APIs** - Verify that component properties, attributes, events, and other APIs are correctly used\n- **Access design tokens** - Use colors, spacing, typography consistently\n- **Learn best practices** - Get implementation guidance and accessibility tips\n\n## How does it work?\n\nThis MCP server provides a set of declarative resources and tools for accessing Tyler Forge documentation. It uses a progressive disclosure model to\nminimize complexity while maximizing accuracy.\n\n### Context-Aware\n\nWhen you start the MCP server in your AI client, it automatically detects the currently installed version of Tyler Forge (if any) in your project. This\nallows it to provide version-specific documentation. If no version is detected, it defaults to the latest stable release that is\nbundled within this MCP server.\n\n### Progressive Disclosure\n\nThe MCP server is designed to minimize cognitive load by exposing only the most essential resources and tools upfront.
