Please make sure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed.\n1. Open Claude desktop app.\n2. Navigate to Settings > Developer.\n3. Click `Edit Config`.\n4. Add the following entry to the `claude_desktop_config.json` file, replacing `ACCESS_TOKEN` value with your [Readwise Access Token](https://readwise.io/access_token).\n```\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"Readwise MCP\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"-y\",\n        \"@readwise/readwise-mcp\"\n      ],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"ACCESS_TOKEN\": \"XXXXXXXXX\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\nFor general troubleshooting guidance, please refer to the official Model Context Protocol Claude Desktop [Troubleshooting section](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user#troubleshooting).\n\nBelow",
