If you're using `nvm` or `brew`, make sure the correct version is active:\n\n```bash\nnode -v\n# Should output v14.x or higher\n```\n\n#### Step 1: Install project dependencies\n\n```bash\nnpm install\n```\n\nThis will install all required packages listed in `package.json`.\n\n> 💡 If you're using `Node.js >=18`, you might face peer dependency issues with packages like `undici`. In that case, upgrade Node.js to `>=20.18.1` or adjust the package version if needed.\n\n#### Step 2: Build the project\n\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n\nThis compiles the source files to the `dist/` directory, which is required to run the MCP server.\n\n> 🛠️ If you see errors related to missing files in `/dist`, ensure you've run the build step successfully.\n\n\n## Configuration\n\nYou will need a Cashfree account with API credentials (we support both sandbox and production keys). You can use Cashfree MCP in your favorite",
