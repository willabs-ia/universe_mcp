It connects AI assistants directly with your Supabase project and allows them to perform tasks like managing tables, fetching config, and querying data. See the [full list of tools](#tools).\n\n## Setup\n\n### 1. Follow our security best practices\n\nBefore setting up the MCP server, we recommend you read our [security best practices](#security-risks) to understand the risks of connecting an LLM to your Supabase projects and how to mitigate them.\n\n\n### 2. Configure your MCP client\n\nThe Supabase MCP server is hosted at `https://mcp.supabase.com/mcp` and supports the Streamable HTTP transport with Dynamic Client Registration OAuth 2.1 authentication.\n\nIf you're running Supabase locally with [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/local-development/cli/getting-started), you can access the MCP server at `http://localhost:54321/mcp`. For [self-hosted Supabase](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting/docker), check the [Enabling MCP server](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting/enable-mcp) page. Currently, the MCP Server in CLI and self-hosted environments offer a limited subset of tools and",
