The Netlify MCP Server acts as a bridge, providing API access, CLI tools, prompts, and more for your agents.\n\nYou can connect to the Netlify MCP Server using a variety of MCP clients, including:\n\n* Windsurf\n* Cursor\n* Claude\n* Copilot (VSCode)\n* Cline\n* Warp\n* LM Studio\n* [See the full list](https://modelcontextprotocol.org/clients)\n\n---\n\n## Use Cases\n\nWith Netlify MCP Server, your AI agents can:\n\n* Create, manage, and deploy Netlify projects\n* Modify access controls for enhanced project security\n* Install or uninstall Netlify extensions\n* Fetch user and team information\n* Enable and manage form submissions\n* Create and manage environment variables and secrets\n* and more...\n---\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n* **Node.js 22 or higher**\n  Check with `node --version`\n* **A Netlify account**\n* **An MCP client** (e.g., Windsurf, Cursor, Claude, Copilot)\n\n> **Tip:** Install the Netlify CLI globally for the best experience:\n> `npm install -g netlify-",
