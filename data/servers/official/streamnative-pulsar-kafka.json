This implementation follows the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) specification, enabling AI applications to access messaging services through a standardized interface.\n\n## Features\n\n- **StreamNative Cloud Integration**: \n  - Connect to StreamNative Cloud resources with authentication\n  - Switch to clusters available in your organization\n  - Describe the status of clusters resources\n- **Apache Kafka Support**: Interact with Apache Kafka resources including:\n  - Kafka Admin operations (topics, partitions, consumer groups)\n  - Schema Registry operations\n  - Kafka Connect operations (*)\n  - Kafka Client operations (producers, consumers)\n- **Apache Pulsar Support**: Interact with Apache Pulsar resources including:\n  - Pulsar Admin operations (topics, namespaces, tenants, schemas, etc.)\n  - Pulsar Client operations (producers, consumers)\n  - Functions, Sources, and Sinks management\n- **Multiple Connection Options**:\n  - Connect to StreamNative Cloud with service account authentication\n  - Connect directly to external Apache Kafka clusters\n  - Connect directly to external Apache Pulsar clus",
