Our tool selection and priorities are focused on developer workflows and debugging use cases, rather than providing a general-purpose MCP server for all Sentry functionality.\n\nThis remote MCP server acts as middleware to the upstream Sentry API, optimized for coding assistants like Cursor, Claude Code, and similar development tools. It's based on [Cloudflare's work towards remote MCPs](https://blog.cloudflare.com/remote-model-context-protocol-servers-mcp/).\n\n## Getting Started\n\nYou'll find everything you need to know by visiting the deployed service in production:\n\n<https://mcp.sentry.dev>\n\nIf you're looking to contribute, learn how it works, or to run this for self-hosted Sentry, continue below.\n\n### Stdio vs Remote\n\nWhile this repository is focused on acting as an MCP service, we also support a `stdio` transport. This is still a work in progress, but is the easiest way to adapt run the MCP against a self-hosted Sentry install.\n\n**Note:** The AI-powered search tools (`search_events` and `search_issues`) require an OpenAI API key. These tools use natural language processing to translate queries into Sentry's query syntax. Without the API key, these specific tools will be unavailable, but all other tools will function normally.\n\nTo utilize the `stdio` ",
