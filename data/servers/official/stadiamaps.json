Use Stadia Maps to get this information.\"\n- \"Geocode the addresses in the attached spreadsheet.\"\n\n## Quickstart\n\n## Building\n\nWe'll use `bun` for all of our instructions,\nbut you can use `npm` too.\n\n1. Run `bun install` to fetch the dependencies.\n2. Then, execute the build script: `bun run build`.\n\nThe built code should be in the `build` directory now.\n\n### ",
