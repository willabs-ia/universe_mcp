The workbench provides a user-friendly UI for creating conversations with one\nor more assistants, configuring settings, and exposing various behaviors.\n\nThe Semantic Workbench is composed of three main components:\n\n- [Workbench Service](workbench-service/README.md) (Python): The backend service that\n  handles core functionalities.\n- [Workbench App](workbench-app/README.md) (React/Typescript): The frontend web user\n  interface for interacting with workbench and assistants.\n- [Assistant Services](examples) (Python, C#, etc.): any number of assistant services that implement the service protocols/APIs,\n  developed using any framework and programming language of your choice.\n\nDesigned to be agnostic of any agent framework, language, or platform, the Semantic Workbench\nfacilitates experimentation, development, testing, and measurement of agent behaviors and workflows.\nAssistants integrate with the workbench via a RESTful API, allowing for flexibility and broad applicability in various development environments.\n\n![Semantic Workbench architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/semanticworkbench/main/docs/images/architecture-animation.gif)\n\n# Workbench interface examples\n\n![Configured dashboard example](docs/images/dashboard_configured_view.p",
