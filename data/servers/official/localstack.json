For questions, issues or feedback, please utilize the [LocalStack Community slack](https://slack.localstack.cloud) or submit a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/localstack/localstack-mcp-server/issues)\n\nA [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro) (MCP) server that provides tools to manage and interact with your [LocalStack for AWS](https://www.localstack.cloud/localstack-for-aws) container for simplified local cloud development and testing. The LocalStack MCP Server provides simplified integration between MCP-compatible apps and your local LocalStack for AWS development environment, enabling secure and direct communication with LocalStack's emulated services and additional developer experience features.\n\nThis server eliminates custom scripts and manual LocalStack management with direct access to:\n\n- Start, stop, restart, and monitor LocalStack for AWS container status with built-in auth.\n- Deploy CDK and Terraform projects with automatic configuration detection.\n- Parse logs, catch errors, and auto-generate IAM policies from violations. (requires active license)\n- Inject chaos faults and network effects into LocalStack to test system resilience. (requires active license)\n- Manage LocalStack state snapshots via [Cloud Pods](https://docs.localstack.cloud/aws/capabilities/state-management/cloud-pods/) for develop",
