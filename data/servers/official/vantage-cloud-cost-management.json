Ask questions about your organization's previous and current cloud cost spend, cost tagging, provider integrations, and more.</h4>\n\n<img src=\"static/img/MCP.png\" alt=\"image\" width=\"600\" height=\"auto\">\n\n</div>\n\n## About the Vantage MCP Server\n\nThe Vantage MCP Server is an open-source tool, written in Golang, that lets you interact with your cloud cost data through AI assistants and MCP clients. By acting as a bridge to Vantage's existing APIs, the Vantage MCP Server lets you query cloud spend data using natural language and makes cost analysis more intuitive.\n\n> 📝 _Note: The Vantage MCP Server is available in both self-hosted and remote forms. This repository supports the self-hosted version, which runs locally using [Standard Input/Output (stdio) Transport](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports#standard-input%2Foutput-stdio). For a remote alternative, see the [Vantage MCP documentation](https://docs.vantage.sh/vantage_mcp)._\n\n### Available Tools\n\nThe Vantage MCP Server currently exposes the following tools, which can be invoked by any compatible MCP client (e.g., Claude, Cursor, Goose):\n\n- `query-costs`\n  - A general purpose way to fetch Cost data using VQL.\n\n- `list-costs`\n\n  - Display all the Costs in an associated Cost Report.\n\n- `list-cost-reports`\n\n  - List all Cost Reports available.\n\n- `get-",
