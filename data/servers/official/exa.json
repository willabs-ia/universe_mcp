It's powered by the Exa search engine.\n\nExamples of queries you can make with `exa-code`:\n* use Exa search in python and make sure content is always livecrawled\n* use correct syntax for vercel ai sdk to call gpt-5 nano asking it how are you\n* how to set up a reproducible Nix Rust development environment\n\n**✨ Works with Cursor and Claude Code!** Use the HTTP-based config",
