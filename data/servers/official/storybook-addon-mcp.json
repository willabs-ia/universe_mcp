This document is for **contributors** looking to develop, test, or contribute to these packages.\n\n## 🚀 Quick Start\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- **Node.js 24+** - The project requires Node.js 24 or higher (see `.nvmrc`)\n- **pnpm 10.19.0+** - Strict package manager requirement (enforced in `package.json`)\n\n```bash\n# Use the correct Node version\nnvm use\n\n# Install pnpm if you don't have it\nnpm install -g pnpm@10.19.0\n```\n\n### Installation\n\n```bash\n# Clone the repository\ngit clone https://github.com/storybookjs/mcp.git\ncd addon-mcp\n\n# Install all dependencies (for all packages in the monorepo)\npnpm install\n```\n\n### Development Workflow\n\n```bash\n# Build all packages\npnpm build\n\n# Start development mode (watches for changes in all packages)\npnpm dev\n\n",
