AgentCortex creates isolated, persistent memory banks for each codebase, so your AI assistant remembers everything—exactly where it belongs.\n\n## 🔥 Why AgentCortex Changes Everything\n\n**The Problem**: AI assistants forget everything between conversations. Worse, when you work on multiple projects, context bleeds between codebases—your React patterns from Project A contaminate your Vue.js work on Project B.\n\n**The Solution**: **Project-isolated persistent memory**. Each project gets its own intelligent memory bank that grows smarter over time, never interfering with your other work.\n\n## ✨ Core Features\n\n### 🎯 **Project Context Separation** *(The Game Changer)*\n- **Isolated memory banks** per project/codebase\n- **Zero context bleeding** between different repos\n- **Automatic project detection** and context switching\n- **Clean slate** for each new project, **full memory** for existing ones\n\n### 🧠 **Persistent Cross-Session Memory**\n- **Never lose context** again across all conversations\n- **Cumulative learn",
