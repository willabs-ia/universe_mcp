It allows you to interact with your Elasticsearch indices through natural language conversations.\n\n## Available Tools\n\n* `list_indices`: List all available Elasticsearch indices\n* `get_mappings`: Get field mappings for a specific Elasticsearch index\n* `search`: Perform an Elasticsearch search with the provided query DSL\n* `esql`: Perform an ES|QL query\n* `get_shards`: Get shard information for all or specific indices\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n* An Elasticsearch instance\n* Elasticsearch authentication credentials (API key or username/password)\n* An MCP Client (e.g. [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download), [Goose](https://block.github.io/goose/))\n\n**Supported Elasticsearch versions**\n\nThis works with Elasticsearch versions `8.x` and `9.x`.\n\n## Installation & Setup\n\n> [!NOTE]\n>\n> Versions 0.3.1 and earlier were installed via `npm`. These versions are deprecated and no longer supported. The following instructions only apply to 0.4.0 and later.\n>\n",
