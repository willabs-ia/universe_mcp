    "readme_excerpt": "# Brave Search MCP Server\n\nAn MCP server implementation that integrates the Brave Search API, providing comprehensive search capabilities including web search, local business search, image search, video search, news search, and AI-powered summarization. This project supports both STDIO and HTTP transports, with STDIO as the default mode.\n\n## Migration\n\n### 1.x to 2.x\n\n#### Default transport now STDIO\n\nTo follow established MCP conventions, the server now defaults to STDIO. If you would like to continue using HTTP, you will need to set the `BRAVE_MCP_TRANSPORT` environment variable to `http`, or provide the runtime argument `--transport http` when launching the server.\n\n#### Response structure of `brave_image_search`\n\nVersion 1.x of the MCP server would return base64-encoded image data along with image URLs. This dramatically slowed down the response, as well as consumed unnecessarily context in the session. Version 2.x removes the base64-encoded data, and returns a response object that more closely reflects the original Brave Search API response. The updated output schema is defined in [`src/tools/images/schemas/output.ts`](https://github.com/brave/brave-search-mcp-server/blob/main/src/tools/images/schemas/output.ts).\n\n## Tools\n\n### Web Search (`brave_web_search`)\nPerforms comprehensive web searches with rich result types and advanced filtering options.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `query` (string, required): Search terms (max 400 chars, 50 words)\n- `country` (string, optional): Countr",
